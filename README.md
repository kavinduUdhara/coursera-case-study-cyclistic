Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

### Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, you work for a
fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. In order to answer the
business questions, follow the steps of the data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process,
Analyze, Share, and Act**. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding
questions and key tasks — will help you stay on the right path.

## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.


## Characters and teams

- **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.
- **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
- **Cyclistic marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals—as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.
- **Cyclistic executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
